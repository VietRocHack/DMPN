APP IDEA: DMPN - Developer Monitoring and Productivity Nexus


Product for a Hackathon. You are only making the Frontend of the app.

This is a "joke" app, which uses your webcam and screen data to generate "aura" points to measure how good of a developer you are. 

As the Frontend, we need to create a homepage, a screen for the user to record screen and webcam data, then send image snapshots of the user's screen and webcam to the backend server (you don't need to implement the backend!), and an admin dashboard screen that recieves "snapshots" of the user, then show the user's "aura" points on a scale. All snapshots are recieved by WebSockets from the backend, you only need to show them and calculate the points of that user.


Screens for the Frontend needed:

 - Homepage
Simple no-scroll landing page with the name, a sentence that shows what we do, and a centered button that redirect to the Aura Calibration Studio Page.


 - Aura Calibration Studio (User Dashboard Page):
The Aura Calibration Studio page ask for permission to use the webcam and the camera; follows the permissions with appropriate dialog, and after the user accepts and share both of the data, you show those data on the dashboard. When both of the data is shared, at routine intervals (default 5s, can be adjusted), send the images as a POST request to an API endpoint (the endpoint is not specified for now). Show a popup whenever images are sent.

 - Aura Observatory (Admin Dashboard Page):
  + This page is connected by WebSockets to a backend server. At random intervals, you will recieve a message from the server with an image, a number that shows the change in aura points, and explanation for the aura point change.
  + This page should look like a dashboard, with a "image-pointchange-explanation" timeline on the left, centralized and heavily styled point count in the middle, and some "tips" for increasing points on the right (don't be distracted, write well-designed code, don't go to Instagram,...)

 - Ranked Aura Page:
 Aside from the user dashboard page, we would like to do a ranked mode between the user and another fearless developers. This page will allow them go to head-to-head aura between two developers and see who are has the higher developer aura. In the User Dashboard, there is a "Ranked Mode" button next to the "User Dashboard" title that opens to another "ranked" screen. Here, on the right side of the screen you will first show (fake) number of current developers searching for ranked aura, a timer setting to see how long would the match be, the second intervals to look for, and a button to enter a queue to do a matchmaking. On the left side of the screen, you show some sort of recent matches between two developers and their aura results along with their round timer (fake). When clicked on matchmaking button, you will fake search on the left side, and when finished, do an animation to start a ranked aura session, which will also contains two halfs. The left will be the user's side, the right will be the other developer's side. Each half will feature the following: name of the user, the webcam and the screen streaming of each user (the user's half will have to enable it themselevs, and you will show the actual footage), while the right half will just show a green ticked box (to confirm that enemy has enabled the webcam and screen recording themselves), a ready button on the user's side and a readied show on the enemy side. When click ready, there should be a 3 second countdown timer, before the button turns into a round timer countdown. 

- Navbar: There should be a Navbar above that has a logo of DMPN and can nav to the three above sections. This should be on all pages.

Style Guide: 

"joke"-like, meme-like, but keep the UX clean. Uses vibrant colors and non-professional looking fonts (but not something too comical like Comic Sans!).
